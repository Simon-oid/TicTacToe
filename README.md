- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- Player 1 is X, and Player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
